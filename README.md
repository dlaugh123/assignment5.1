# assignment5.1
The assignment tasked us to examin a dataset reflecting whether drivers accepted a coupon code delivered to their cell phone.

For the independent investigation portion of the assignment, I first examined acceptance rates by coupon type.  From this, it appeared that the inexpensive restaurant and carry out coupon types were getting reasonably good acceptance across the board (>65%). We had already analyzed to some extent the bar coupon type in the assigned analysis.  So I chose the next least successful coupon type, expensive restaurant ($20-$50).

First I generated a clustered bar plot to analyze the effect of age and passenger type on coupon acceptance.  This output suggested that passenger type 'partner' acceptance rates are high, especially with drivers 31-46.  I ran an analysis on this subset to confirm, which indicated that the coupon acceptance rate for drivers 31-46 with a partner was 80%, versus 43% for all other drivers.

Then I generated a simple bar plot to analyze the effect of occupation on coupon acceptance.  This output suggested that coupon acceptance rates are high for professions with 'support' in the title.  I ran an analysis on this subset to confirm, which indicated that the coupon acceptance rate for drivers 31-46 with a partner was 63%, versus 43% for all other drivers.

From these two analysis subsets, I would recommend that the coupon corproation target drivers who have their parnter in the car, drivers who are 31-46, and/or drivers who work in 'support' professions.
